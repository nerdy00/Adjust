#Imagine a server with the following specs:
#4 times Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E7-4830 v4 @ 2.00GHz / 64GB of ram
#2 tb HDD disk space
#2 x 10Gbit/s nics
#The server is used for SSL offloading and proxies around 25000 requests per second.
#Please let us know which metrics are interesting to monitor in that specific case and how would you do that?  
# What are the challenges of monitoring this?


#Solution
The metrics that would be interesting to monitor in this case are:
  1. Disk Space ( So that the disk space doesnt run out of memory) Solution ( normally log files fill up the space good to have log rotation in place.
  2. Cpu Usage ( Since it handles 25000 requests/sec a huge influx of requests might burden the resources so good to have that monitored). Depending on which process burdens the server a remediation can be done .
  3. Traffic Flow ( The amount of traffic that is recieved ) if traffic recieved is more than expected and burdens the server better to have a load balancer in place,
